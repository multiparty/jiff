# Compute the Sum of Arrays with MPC as a Service

## Before Getting Started
This demo is run by Cypress. The package.json includes Cypress installation, however, if needed, you can install it separately with `npm install cypress --save-dev`.

## Protocol üíª
This example demonstrates a distributed MPC computation that sums two arrays of integers, involving three computing parties and two input parties. 
This unique implementation allows even resource-restricted participants to engage by outsourcing the actual calculations to third parties.

## Running Demo üèÉüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
> **Beware that this protocol utilizes an independent server and follows a unique process.**

**1. Run the server**

```shell
node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/server.js
```
> **‚ö†Ô∏èImportant:** You must run a fresh server every time. For example, if a test is paused at any point, it is required to terminate the server and restart it before running the rest of the demo.

**2. Initiate computing parties**

   Run this **three times** in **different terminals** (By this operation, you ought to have at least three terminals open)
```
node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json
```

**3. Open the Cypress Test Runner üé• (with video demos)**

    1) Run `npm run cypress:open` in CML

    2) Choose a browser (Chrome Recommended)

    3) Click a demo protocol of your choice

</div>


**4. Interpret the Result üßê**

After a second to a few seconds of executing the test by the above 2 steps, you will see the following results, if successful:

    <img width="30%" height="30%" alt="image" src="https://github.com/multiparty/jiff/assets/62607343/4c585335-57e7-4240-a2d5-ab5da3779af2">
</div>

Remember that this image is just an example. Your result may look slightly different.

## Alternatively... ‚òû‚òû
The demo/test can be run from the command line without videos.

**1. Run the following block of code in your terminal**
   
```shell
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/server.js & echo $! > SERVER_PID
  sleep 10
  echo "Initiating three computational parties"
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json &
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json &
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json &
  sleep 5
  echo "Running the cypress test for two input parties"
  npx cypress run --config-file demos/cypress.config.ts --spec "demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/test.cy.ts"
  kill $(cat SERVER_PID) || true
```
    
**2. Interpret the result in the CML**

## There is something more... üì¶
The demo can be run without Cypress

**1. Run the server & computation parties**

```shell
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/server.js & echo $! > SERVER_PID
  sleep 10
  echo "Initiating three computational parties"
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json &
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json &
  node demos/array-mpc-as-a-service/compute-party.js config.json 
```

**2. Experiment on a Browser**

## Code Structure ‚å®Ô∏è

This Cypress-based demo adopts the web-worker system to emulate multiple threaded execution. 
In the real-world MPC implementation, clients act in a distributed manner, allowing multiple users to send data from separate browsers.
However, the Cypress test framework does not allow multiple tabs/windows, and therefore, it is necessary to make the demo test run as if multiple inputs were submitted from their browsers.

Here, the web-worker system plays a central role. The `client.js` interfaces with the `client.html`, containing UI components. `client.js` sends the required instructions to the `web-worker.js`.
The web worker then calls MPC functions, connects & computes, and returns results to the `client.js`, which then gets displayed in the UI. In this example, the computing parties are initiated by `compute-party.js`, which performs the actual computations and sends the computed results to the client-mpc via the server.
