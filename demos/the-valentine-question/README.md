# The Valentine Question

## Before Getting Started
This demo is run by Cypress. The package.json includes Cypress installation, however, if needed, you can install it separately with `npm install cypress --save-dev`.

## Protocol üíª
This protocol allows two parties to privately indicate their interest in a Valentine's Day date. Each party submits either "yes" or "no." The date proceeds only if both parties answer "yes"; otherwise, it is canceled. To maintain privacy, a negative response is kept confidential from the other party. Responses are encoded as "yes" = 1 and "no" = 0, allowing the protocol to compute the outcome by multiplication. The result "1 x 1" signifies the date is on, while any multiplication involving a "0" (i.e., "0 x 0" or "0 x 1") leads to cancellation.

The implementation of this protocol is located in <a href="https://github.com/multiparty/jiff/blob/master/demos/the-valentine-question/mpc.js">mpc.js</a>.

## Running Demo üèÉüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**1. Run the server**

    ```shell
    node demos/support/server.ts   
    ```
> **‚ö†Ô∏èImportant:** You must run a fresh server every time. For example, if a test is paused at any point, it is required to terminate the server and restart it before running the rest of the demo.</I> 

**2. Run from the Cypress Test Runner üé• (with video demos)**

    1) Run `npm run cypress:open` in CML

    2) Choose a browser (Chrome Recommended)

    </div>
    
    3) Click a demo protocol of your choice

    </div>


**3. Interpret the Result üßê**

After a second to a few seconds of executing the test by above 2 steps, you will see the following results, if successful:

    </div>

Remember that this image is just an example. Your result may look slightly different.

## Alternatively... ‚òû‚òû
The demo/test can be run from the command line without videos.

**1. Run the server in the same way**

   ```shell
   node demos/support/server.ts
   ```

**2. Run from the command line ‚å®Ô∏è (without visual demos)**

    ```shell
    npx cypress run --config-file demos/cypress.config.ts --spec "demos/the-valentine-question/test.cy.ts"
    ```
    
**3. Interpret the result in the CML**

## Code Structure ‚å®Ô∏è

This Cypress-based demo adopts the web-worker system to emulate multiple threaded execution. 
In the real-world MPC implementation, clients act in a distributed manner, allowing multiple users to send data from separate browsers.
However, the Cypress test framework does not allow multiple tabs/windows, and therefore, it is necessary to make the demo test run as if multiple inputs were submitted from their browsers.

Here, the web-worker system plays a central role. The `client.js` interfaces with the `client.html`, containing UI components. `client.js` sends the required instructions to the `web-worker.js`.
The web worker then calls MPC functions, connects & computes, and returns results to the `client.js`, which then gets displayed in the UI.
